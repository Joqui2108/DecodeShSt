#DecodeShSt
Decode sh.st URLs using javascript.

## Usage
To decode sh.st URL:

~~~
./sh.st.js {sh.stUrl}
~~~

Must have "http://" in the URL or it won't work.

***
Somehow as it's only a simple GET request, sh.st redirects you automaticaly, without needing to wait 5 seconds to skip the advertisement.
